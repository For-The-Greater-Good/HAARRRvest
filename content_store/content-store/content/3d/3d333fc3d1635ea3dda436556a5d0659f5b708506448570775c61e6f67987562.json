We are here to be the hands and feet of Jesus . It is a  joy  to serve our city directly and help them during a difficult season.  We have a food pantry and thrift store on site , with clothes starting at  low as 50 cents a piece . In order to receive a free food box from the drive thru, you need to provide  photo ID that shows you live in the county .&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We are thankful for the donations we get weekly from Walmart, HEB and Dollar General. We never know what we will get and that is why some boxes may look different. It is solely by what we received that morning or the day prior.    &nbsp;    Jesus replied, \\u201cI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry again.
