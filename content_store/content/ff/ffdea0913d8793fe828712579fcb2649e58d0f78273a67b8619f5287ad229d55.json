We do not advertise our address, because it is not a place clients can come (just a little storage room). Our food is delivered to households in 20874 and 20876. People can self-refer by calling 301-482-1320 and leaving a message; we call people back in the order the messages are received. We currently deliver nonperishable items and milk, produce, eggs & bread.\\n\\nWe are closed on most major holidays, but may be open during federal holidays, depending on volunteer availability. Severe weather will close us down for the safety of our delivery volunteers. People can receive a delivery about once a month; when we are very busy, it will be stretched a little further. There is NO GUARANTEE of delivery once a month. We do not schedule deliveries more than a day or two in advance. We will not leave food at the door if nobody is home, we have to see it go inside the door.\", \"email\": \"\", \"url\": null, \"status\": \"active\", \"address\": {\"address_1\": \"PO Box 608\", \"address_2\": null, \"city\": \"Germantown\", \"state_province\": \"MD\", \"postal_code\": \"20875\", \"country\": \"US\"}, \"location\": {\"latitude\": 39.17553, \"longitude\": -77.26753}, \"phones\": [{\"number\": \"(301) 482-1320\", \"type\": \"voice\"}], \"service_attributes\": [{\"attribute_key\": \"INFO\", \"attribute_value\": \"Closed During Year: Inclement weather\"}, {\"attribute_key\": \"INFO\", \"attribute_value\": \"Closed on major holidays\"}, {\"attribute_key\": \"REQUIREMENT\", \"attribute_value\": \"Clients can receive grocery delivery maximum of once a month (not guaranteed)\"}]}",
