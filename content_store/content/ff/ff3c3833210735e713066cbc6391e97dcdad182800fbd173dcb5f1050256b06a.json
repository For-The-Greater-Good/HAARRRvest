Registration is required.&nbsp; We need to know about the families we are serving, so that we can share demographic information with the organizations that provide us funding.&nbsp; Information we collect includes address, birthdays, incomes, disabilities, and similar.&nbsp; It is self-reported; you do not need to bring any documents.  LTN is a shopper's choice food pantry.&nbsp; Customers get a grocery cart, register at the front desk, and proceed along a defined pathway, shopping from what we have.&nbsp; Shopping typically takes about 30 minutes.  A household is allowed to shop once per week.  Volunteers strive to provide a dignified, respectful, loving, community-oriented environment.&nbsp; We welcome everyone who comes to us!&nbsp; If you have special needs, please contact us at kgc.ltn@gmail.com.&nbsp; Our resources are limited, but we try to accommodate when we can.
