Upon arrival, our staff members will check you in (or sign you up if you are not already a member!) and tell you your weekly point allocation based on your family size. Each item within the Market has a point value, and you are free to shop for whatever items you need until you have reached your weekly point number. We operate on a trust system, so we do not count points or check bags. We recommend everyone brings their own reusable bag!\", \"email\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.mercy.edu/student-support/mav-market\", \"status\": \"active\", \"address\": {\"address_1\": \"1200 Waters Place\", \"address_2\": null, \"city\": \"Pelham Bay\", \"state_province\": \"NY\", \"postal_code\": \"10461\", \"country\": \"US\"}, \"location\": {\"latitude\": 40.8521558, \"longitude\": -73.8371086}, \"phones\": [{\"number\": \"(718) 677-8209\", \"type\": \"voice\"}], \"regular_schedule\": [{\"weekday\": \"Wednesday\", \"opens_at\": \"15:00\", \"closes_at\": \"19:00\"}, {\"weekday\": \"Thursday\", \"opens_at\": \"17:00\", \"closes_at\": \"21:00\"}], \"service_attributes\": [{\"attribute_key\": \"REQUIREMENT\", \"attribute_value\": \"Students & staff only\"}]}",
