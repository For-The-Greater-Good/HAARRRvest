Three to five meals are delivered each week (older adults are assigned a delivery day and window of time to expect the delivery). There is a sliding-scale contribution of **$5/meal** down to **$1/meal**.\\n\\n- There may be a wait list for this program (it changes week-to-week), but in an emergency situation, Kosher Meals at Home can usually assist with meals short-term until a case management agency can take over the meal delivery. \\n\\n- The older adult requesting meals needs to be able to safely heat the meals in a microwave or regular oven on their own (or have an aide or family member/caregiver who can heat the meals for them). Meals cannot be heated in a toaster oven unless they are transferred to another dish that is safe.   \", \"email\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.dorotusa.org/our-programs/at-home/kosher-meals-at-home\", \"status\": \"active\", \"address\": {\"address_1\": \"171 West 85th Street\", \"address_2\": null, \"city\": \"New York\", \"state_province\": \"NY\", \"postal_code\": \"10024\", \"country\": \"US\"}, \"location\": {\"latitude\": 40.7870587, \"longitude\": -73.97502539999999}, \"phones\": [{\"number\": \"(212) 769-2850\", \"type\": \"voice\"}], \"regular_schedule\": [{\"weekday\": \"Monday\", \"opens_at\": \"14:00\", \"closes_at\": \"21:00\"}, {\"weekday\": \"Tuesday\", \"opens_at\": \"14:00\", \"closes_at\": \"21:00\"}, {\"weekday\": \"Wednesday\", \"opens_at\": \"14:00\", \"closes_at\": \"21:00\"}, {\"weekday\": \"Thursday\", \"opens_at\": \"14:00\", \"closes_at\": \"21:00\"}, {\"weekday\": \"Friday\", \"opens_at\": \"14:00\", \"closes_at\": \"21:00\"}], \"service_attributes\": [{\"attribute_key\": \"REQUIREMENT\", \"attribute_value\": \"Call in advance for services\"}]}",
