They have a desire to help people in any capacity that they can. After relocating to Coolidge, AZ, in 2014, and getting to know the people in the community, their goal became identifying the needs of their neighbors, so that they could help strengthen the  community.  Understanding that there was a severe need, they decided to open the Food Pantry on Main Street, where they served upwards of 900 people a month with the help of Hope International Ministry, United Food Bank, and Midwest Food Bank along with other organizations and individuals. After shutting down for one year to find a new location, the pantry relocated to Arizona Blvd. Three days a month, along with a group of very gracious and caring volunteers, they help and serve their wonderful neighbors and anyone who finds their way to the pantry. They have also established a limited resource center within the food pantry, in which they strive to be a one-stop shop for all of the needs of their community.\", \"notes\": \"\", \"contactName\": \"Hope International Food Pantry\", \"contactPhone\": \"520-233-6699\", \"contactEmail\": \"\", \"servicePrograms\": \"\", \"foodServiceTypes\": \"CSFP Program, Emergency Food Bags, TEFAP Program\", \"dietRestrictions\": \"\", \"foodOfferings\": \"\", \"networkAffiliations\": [{\"regionId\": 46, \"regionName\": \"United Food Bank\", \"logoBlobNameSmall\": \"44cc95f0-b2ef-423d-9209-442ae7382fb4.png\", \"website\": \"https://www.unitedfoodbank.org/\"}], \"timeZoneName\": \"Mountain Standard Time\", \"timeZoneCode\": \"MT\", \"offsetHours\": \"-6\", \"schedules\": [\"Thursday 7:00 AM-9:00 AM\", \"Thursday 7:00 AM-9:00 AM\", \"Thursday 7:00 AM-9:00 AM\"], \"services\": [], \"specialHours\": []}",
