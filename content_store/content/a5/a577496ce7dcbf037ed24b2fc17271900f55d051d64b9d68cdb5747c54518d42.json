The Food Bank sign is also posted out front. Some will be at the door  to direct the clients into the building. The food giveaway is announced in the newspaper and on Facebook a week before the food giveaway. We give out food   every Saturday of the month from 11:00 am until all food boxes are gone.  Proof of address must be at least your driver's license, identification, or utility bills. Once the client comes for the first time, their intake information is entered into  our computer/table. When they come the next month, they only need to show their identification.  &nbsp;  Since we have a large number of seniors coming to get food, we have volunteers on hand to help them get their food to their vehicles if need be.  We also have other ministries who donate clothes, furniture, and other household items. They are allowed to get these items if they need them.\", \"contactName\": \"Saint Mary Harris\", \"contactPhone\": \"870-872-2196\", \"contactEmail\": \"houseofbread0894@sbcglobal.net\", \"servicePrograms\": \"\", \"foodServiceTypes\": \"\", \"dietRestrictions\": \"\", \"foodOfferings\": \"\", \"networkAffiliations\": [{\"regionId\": 72, \"regionName\": \"Arkansas Foodbank\", \"logoBlobNameSmall\": \"1c4a6bd3-8e23-4c7c-b75a-6bd6f5204146.png\", \"website\": \"https://arkansasfoodbank.org/\"}], \"timeZoneName\": \"Central Standard Time\", \"timeZoneCode\": \"CT\", \"offsetHours\": \"-5\", \"schedules\": [\"Monday 1:00 PM-4:30 PM\"], \"services\": [], \"specialHours\": []}",
