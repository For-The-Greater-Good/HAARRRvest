Powered by kindness, generosity, and most importantly, love, we firmly believe that feeding oneself is not a privilege, but a right.\\n\\nWith food insecurity at an all-time high, keeping our communities fed is now more important than ever. Our volunteers come from all over Chicago, working within their own neighborhoods to collaborate with like-minded partners to place community refrigerators across the city. \\n\\nThese refrigerators, painted by local artists to reflect the communities in which they live, provide neighbors the opportunity to donate food as well as take what they need, ensuring accessible food 24/7. \", \"email\": \"\", \"url\": \"Thelovefridge.com\", \"status\": \"active\", \"address\": {\"address_1\": null, \"address_2\": null, \"city\": null, \"state_province\": null, \"postal_code\": null, \"country\": \"US\"}, \"location\": {\"latitude\": null, \"longitude\": null}, \"phones\": [{\"number\": \"(312) 597-5310\", \"type\": \"voice\"}]}",
