Distribution is by a \\\"drive thru\\\" that is, all patrons will drive through the parking lot and food will be placed into the vehicle's trunk.  \\n\\nPlease have your trunk clear - only food that will fit into the car trunk will be given away. \\nWe do this to keep vehicles off the highway and to keep our patrons safe.\\nWait time varies depending on time of arrival at least 1 - 1 1/2hour.\\n\\nIf the students reside in the dorms in POLK County that is their residence at time of pick up.. Also, if a student is in need of food I am sure we can accommodate the student.\", \"email\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.blessingsandhope.org/\", \"status\": \"active\", \"address\": {\"address_1\": \"4730 Lakeland Highlands Road\", \"address_2\": null, \"city\": \"Lakeland\", \"state_province\": \"FL\", \"postal_code\": \"33813\", \"country\": \"US\"}, \"location\": {\"latitude\": 27.979769, \"longitude\": -81.9225331}, \"phones\": [{\"number\": \"(863) 698-7512\", \"type\": \"voice\"}], \"regular_schedule\": [{\"weekday\": \"Tuesday\", \"opens_at\": \"14:00\", \"closes_at\": \"16:00\"}], \"service_attributes\": [{\"attribute_key\": \"REQUIREMENT\", \"attribute_value\": \"Registration required on site\"}, {\"attribute_key\": \"REQUIREMENT\", \"attribute_value\": \"Drive-Thru Only\"}]}",
