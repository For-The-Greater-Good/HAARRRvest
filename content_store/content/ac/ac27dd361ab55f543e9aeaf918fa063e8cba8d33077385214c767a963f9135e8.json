Sign up online & get matched to a volunteer in your community who will deliver a free home-cooked lasagna. Fulfillment time depends on where you live \\u2013 it can take several weeks to receive food. Enter your zip code here to see the expected wait time:   https://lasagnalove.org/zip-code/\\n\\nWe do not have any qualifications to receive a meal. We understand that need comes in many forms and they are not always financial. Our core values are to feed families, spread kindness, and strengthen communities. You can visit us at https://www.lasagnalove.org/ to see more about how the process works. I've also attached a couple of resources that provide information about Lasagna Love. \\n\\nYou may have times where you know of families in need. You can share the attached flyer with families, and you can also nominate families by going to https://www.lasagnalove.org/nominate/. Once a nomination has been made, Lasagna Love sends the nominated family a text with a link to sign up. It is up to the family to decide if they would like to send in their request for a meal. This allows us to verify any food allergy or dietary needs with the family. They will then be contacted directly by a volunteer once they are matched! \\n\\n\\nRequest a meal here: https://lasagnalove.org/request-a-meal/\", \"email\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://lasagnalove.org/request-a-meal/\", \"status\": \"active\", \"address\": {\"address_1\": null, \"address_2\": null, \"city\": \"New York\", \"state_province\": \"New York\", \"postal_code\": \"\", \"country\": \"US\"}, \"location\": {\"latitude\": 40.7127753, \"longitude\": -74.0059728}}",
