We will no longer be first come first served.\\n* Customers coming in after the lottery will be given a number as they enter the building.\\nYou will still need a photo ID and proof of address.\\n* If it\\u2019s your first visit of the month we will give you a blue number tag for a full shop. We will also give you a ticket that lets you know how much of each item you can take.\\n* If you\\u2019ve already visited the pantry this month we will give you a green number tag for produce.\\n* Only one person from your family can go into the shopping area. For safety reasons children are not allowed in the shopping area (except the produce only area).\\n* If you are a proxy picking up food for someone else you can only shop for one family at a time.\\n* Please bring your own reusable shopping bags. As many grocers are no longer giving out bags anymore, we don\\u2019t have enough.\\n* First week of the month is very busy. Come later in the month for faster service.\\n* If you see any ways we can improve as we make this change, please let us know.\", \"email\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.dublinfoodpantry.org/get-help/\", \"status\": \"active\", \"address\": {\"address_1\": \"6608 Dublin Center Drive\", \"address_2\": null, \"city\": \"Dublin\", \"state_province\": \"OH\", \"postal_code\": \"43017\", \"country\": \"US\"}, \"location\": {\"latitude\": 40.1029259, \"longitude\": -83.093215}, \"phones\": [{\"number\": \"(614) 889-6590\", \"type\": \"voice\"}], \"regular_schedule\": [{\"weekday\": \"Monday\", \"opens_at\": \"21:00\", \"closes_at\": \"23:00\"}, {\"weekday\": \"Tuesday\", \"opens_at\": \"14:00\", \"closes_at\": \"16:00\"}, {\"weekday\": \"Thursday\", \"opens_at\": \"14:00\", \"closes_at\": \"16:00\"}, {\"weekday\": \"Wednesday\", \"opens_at\": \"20:00\", \"closes_at\": \"22:30\"}], \"service_attributes\": [{\"attribute_key\": \"REQUIREMENT\", \"attribute_value\": \"Must bring own bags/cart\"}, {\"attribute_key\": \"INFO\", \"attribute_value\": \"Closed During Year: Inclement weather\"}, {\"attribute_key\": \"OFFERING\", \"attribute_value\": \"Clients can visit: Once a month\"}, {\"attribute_key\": \"REQUIREMENT\", \"attribute_value\": \"Bring ID and proof of residence\"}, {\"attribute_key\": \"REQUIREMENT\", \"attribute_value\": \"Get a number/ticket\"}, {\"attribute_key\": \"INFO\", \"attribute_value\": \"Closed on major holidays\"}]}",
