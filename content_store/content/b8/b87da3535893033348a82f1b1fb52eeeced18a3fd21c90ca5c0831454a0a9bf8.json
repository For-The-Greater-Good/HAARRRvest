Based on donations from local businesses, we also try to distribute milk and cheese, baked goods, meats, and ready-made meals.  \\n\\n**We give out food and cleaning items every Sunday from 1 to 3 pm, rain or shine. If pantry guests arrive at 2 pm, the line is shorter and there still is plenty of food. We are open on holidays. \\n\\n- For people who are unable to visit the pantry in person due to disability, we deliver groceries to homes during  weekends. This depends on how many volunteer drivers we have. \\n\\n- We are located behind the building at 4340 Connecticut Ave NW, Washington, DC. We are a block north of the Van Ness Metro station on the Red line on the west side.\\n\\n**People can text or call NW Community Food at (202) 743-5770.
