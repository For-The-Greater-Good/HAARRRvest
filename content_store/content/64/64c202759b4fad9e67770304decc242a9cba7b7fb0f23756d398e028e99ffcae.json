We have had large number of requests and it is taking up to 4-5 days for our initial contact to schedule a delivery.  PLEASE NOTE: NNEMAP's Delivery Service is NOT an emergency service. Because of the number of requests received we are generally scheduling deliveries 3-4 weeks from now. Scheduling dates are subject to change based on request volume. Please note that if we cannot contact you, we will be unable to deliver to you. Deliveries are limited to two times per month.  You may only receive food from NNEMAP Food Pantry once per week, no matter the method (in-person, delivery, or locker pick-up).\\n\\nPlease respond to our text messages or telephone calls.  The sooner you respond the quicker we can provide your delivery. You may access food from NNEMAP once per week (in-person, delivery, or lockers).\\nNNEMAP Delivers Monday through Saturdays, generally between 11:30am and 3:30pm.  We are currently using DoorDash to make some of our deliveries, and they will text you with their progress as they make a delivery to you.  If you are not at your residence and have not contacted us (614-297-0533) to cancel your scheduled delivery, the box(es) will be left at your door and the delivery will be considered complete.\", \"email\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.nnemappantry.org/\", \"status\": \"active\", \"address\": {\"address_1\": \"677 East 11th Avenue\", \"address_2\": null, \"city\": \"Milo-Grogan\", \"state_province\": \"OH\", \"postal_code\": \"43211\", \"country\": \"US\"}, \"location\": {\"latitude\": 39.9937585, \"longitude\": -82.98833239999999}, \"phones\": [{\"number\": \"(614) 297-0533\", \"type\": \"voice\"}], \"regular_schedule\": [{\"weekday\": \"Monday\", \"opens_at\": \"13:00\", \"closes_at\": \"16:00\"}, {\"weekday\": \"Tuesday\", \"opens_at\": \"13:00\", \"closes_at\": \"16:00\"}, {\"weekday\": \"Friday\", \"opens_at\": \"13:00\", \"closes_at\": \"16:00\"}, {\"weekday\": \"Monday\", \"opens_at\": \"16:30\", \"closes_at\": \"20:30\"}, {\"weekday\": \"Tuesday\", \"opens_at\": \"16:30\", \"closes_at\": \"20:30\"}, {\"weekday\": \"Wednesday\", \"opens_at\": \"16:30\", \"closes_at\": \"20:30\"}, {\"weekday\": \"Thursday\", \"opens_at\": \"16:30\", \"closes_at\": \"20:30\"}, {\"weekday\": \"Friday\", \"opens_at\": \"16:30\", \"closes_at\": \"20:30\"}, {\"weekday\": \"Saturday\", \"opens_at\": \"16:30\", \"closes_at\": \"20:30\"}], \"service_attributes\": [{\"attribute_key\": \"REQUIREMENT\", \"attribute_value\": \"Photo ID and proof of address is required for adults 18+\"}]}",
