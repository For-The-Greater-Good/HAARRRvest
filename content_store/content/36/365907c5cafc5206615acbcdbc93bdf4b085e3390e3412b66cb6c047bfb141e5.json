Our desire is to eliminate hunger in our community by acquiring and distributing food to those who seek aid. We place great emphasis on serving our clients with dignity and respect, seen both in the food we serve and in the setting in which it is served.&nbsp;  The Community Center was founded in 2006 to serve local residents of St. Bernard Parish after the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina and Rita. As our center evolved, we realized our focus needed to change. In 2016, our center focused on providing food and essentials to St. Bernard Parish. We currently operate as a food pantry for low income residents of St. Bernard, serving over 200 families per month and are growing weekly. ? Our center is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and was established to provide residents of St. Bernard Parish with the services and resources needed to rebuild their lives, their homes and their community. We are a United Way Partner Agency as well as a Second Harvest partner agency.  \\\"At the Community Center of St. Bernard, we believe that having access to nutritious food is a top priority. We are committed to responding to the needs of our community through our Food Pantry. We value and respect every client that comes through our doors. We are here for you.\\\"\", \"notes\": \"Our facility is located on the corner of St. Claude Ave and Friscoville in Old Arabi.&nbsp;\", \"contactName\": \"Jamie Richardson\", \"contactPhone\": \"504-518-5968\", \"contactEmail\": \"communitycenterstb@gmail.com\", \"servicePrograms\": \"\", \"foodServiceTypes\": \"\", \"dietRestrictions\": \"\", \"foodOfferings\": \"\", \"networkAffiliations\": [{\"regionId\": 38, \"regionName\": \"Second Harvest Food Bank Feeding South Louisiana\", \"logoBlobNameSmall\": \"e342973b-0cc0-4794-b3f9-080cdb5ba8df.png\", \"website\": \"https://no-hunger.org/\"}], \"timeZoneName\": \"Central Standard Time\", \"timeZoneCode\": \"CT\", \"offsetHours\": \"-5\", \"schedules\": [\"Tuesday 8:00 AM-10:00 AM\", \"Wednesday 8:00 AM-11:00 AM\", \"Thursday 8:00 AM-11:00 AM\"], \"services\": [], \"specialHours\": []}",
