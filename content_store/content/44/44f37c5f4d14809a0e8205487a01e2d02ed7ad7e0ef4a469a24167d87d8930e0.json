This allows the volunteers time to prepare their order.  Blank forms are located outside of the church around the left side of the building by the pantry pick-up door.  There are 2 marked mailboxes there -- one with blank forms and one for their completed forms.  Any completed forms left after the due date/time noted on the form will not be processed until the following Pantry date.
