The input only contains statistics about the scraping process (360 locations found, 16 unique locations, etc.) but no details about the actual food pantry locations, addresses, phone numbers, or services.\n\nTo convert this to HSDS format, I would need the actual organizational data such as:\n- Organization name and details\n- Location addresses\n- Contact information\n- Services offered\n- Operating hours\n- Any other relevant details about the food pantries\n\nCould you provide the actual food pantry data that needs to be converted?",
