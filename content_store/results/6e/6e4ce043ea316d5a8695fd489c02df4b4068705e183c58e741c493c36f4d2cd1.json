Food insecurity refers to having limited food available, including a reduction in the quality, safety or variety of food or ability to acquire food in a socially acceptable manner. Researchers have suggested that food insecurity is an issue that an estimated half of all college students struggle with. At UTEP, we recognize that food insecurity is an obstacle to student success and think it's crucial that students' basic needs are being met.\"\n  },\n  \"services\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"svc_1\",\n      \"name\": \"Food Pantry\",\n      \"description\": \"Offers support and assistance to UTEP students who are dealing with food insecurity.\",\n      \"status\": \"active\",\n      \"metadata\": {\n        \"last_action_date\": \"2023-10-27\"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"locations\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"loc_1\",\n      \"name\": \"UTEP Food Pantry Location\",\n      \"address\": {\n        \"address_type\": \"physical\",\n        \"city\": null,\n        \"state_province\": null,\n        \"postal_code\": null,\n        \"country\": \"US\"\n      },\n      \"coordinates\": {\n        \"latitude\": 31.775609,\n        \"longitude\": -106.5047356\n      },\n      \"location_type\": \"physical\",\n      \"metadata\": {\n        \"last_action_date\": \"2023-10-27\"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"phones\": [\n    {\n      \"number\": \"915-747-8053\",\n      \"type\": \"voice\",\n      \"languages\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"English\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"last_action_date\": \"2023-10-27\"\n  }\n}",
