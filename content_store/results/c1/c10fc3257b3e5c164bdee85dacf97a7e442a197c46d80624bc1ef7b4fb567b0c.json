Powered by kindness, generosity, and most importantly, love, we firmly believe that feeding oneself is not a privilege, but a right. With food insecurity at an all-time high, keeping our communities fed is now more important than ever. Our volunteers come from all over Chicago, working within their own neighborhoods to collaborate with like-minded partners to place community refrigerators across the city. These refrigerators, painted by local artists to reflect the communities in which they live, provide neighbors the opportunity to donate food as well as take what they need, ensuring accessible food 24/7.\",\n    \"url\": \"Thelovefridge.com\",\n    \"email\": null,\n    \"status\": \"active\",\n    \"addresses\": [\n      {\n        \"address_type\": \"physical\",\n        \"address_1\": null,\n        \"address_2\": null,\n        \"city\": \"Chicago\",\n        \"state_province\": \"IL\",\n        \"postal_code\": null,\n        \"country\": \"US\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"phones\": [\n      {\n        \"number\": \"312-597-5310\",\n        \"type\": \"voice\",\n        \"languages\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"English\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"metadata\": {\n      \"org_id\": \"org_1\",\n      \"last_action_date\": \"2023-10-27\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"locations\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Love Fridge - Chicago\",\n      \"location_type\": \"physical\",\n      \"addresses\": [\n        {\n          \"address_type\": \"physical\",\n          \"address_1\": null,\n          \"address_2\": null,\n          \"city\": \"Chicago\",\n          \"state_province\": \"IL\",\n          \"postal_code\": null,\n          \"country\": \"US\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"coordinates\": [],\n      \"metadata\": {\n        \"loc_id\": \"loc_1\",\n        \"last_action_date\": \"2023-10-27\"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"services\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Love Fridge - Chicago\",\n      \"description\": \"Community refrigerators providing 24/7 access to donated food.\",\n      \"service_type\": \"Food Pantry\",\n      \"status\": \"active\",\n      \"locations\": [\n        \"loc_1\"\n      ],\n      \"schedule\": [\n        {\n          \"freq\": \"WEEKLY\",\n          \"wkst\": \"MO\",\n          \"days\": [\n            \"MON\",\n            \"TUE\",\n            \"WED\",\n            \"THU\",\n            \"FRI\",\n            \"SAT\",\n            \"SUN\"\n          ],\n          \"time_start\": \"00:00\",\n          \"time_end\": \"23:59\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"metadata\": {\n        \"svc_id\": \"svc_1\",\n        \"last_action_date\": \"2023-10-27\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
