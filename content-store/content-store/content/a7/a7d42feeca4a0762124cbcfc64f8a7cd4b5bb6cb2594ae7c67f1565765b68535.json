We also assist with Snap Information and information on other helpflul organizations depending on what each visitor may need.   Our emblem is Loaves and fishes because we can feed so many with so little if we work together in conjuction with our community and The Low Country Food Bank in Charleston where our warehouse is located. We operate only from donations from our Community and surrounding areas. We can offer clothing&nbsp;free due to all the generous people who donate these clothes in various sizes.
