Originally named the Christian Mission, it was later renamed the Salvation Army in 1878. The organization\\u2019s mission, then and now, is to serve the poor, homeless, hungry, and destitute. With a legacy of over 150 years, The Salvation Army continues to provide services to the underserved in over 130 countries. In the United States alone, nearly 36 million Americans receive assistance from The Salvation Army yearly.   Since 1891, the Salvation Army has been a pillar of support in Larimer County, providing a comprehensive range of support to those in need and the most vulnerable. This support includes not only food, clothing, and shelter but also encouragement, comfort, and prayer. In 2016, the Loveland Salvation Army Service Center opened its physical location in Loveland, offering individuals and families a safe and supportive environment in which to receive services. The Salvation of Loveland (SAL) is committed to addressing all needs and meeting those needs through short and long-term assistance. Last year the Salvation Army of Loveland had 31,872 encounters providing food, clothing, transportation tokens, respite care, rent assistance, pet food, and hygiene items while responding to emergencies and natural disasters in Larimer County. The SAL is the only agency in Northern Colorado that provides respite care to medically fragile homeless individuals by providing them with a safe place to recover from an illness or injury.\", \"notes\": \"\", \"contactName\": \"Volunteer Team\", \"contactPhone\": \"970-699-8380\", \"contactEmail\": \"Vol.Imlov@usw.salvationarmy.org\", \"servicePrograms\": \"\", \"foodServiceTypes\": \"Accepts Walk-Ins, Dietary Menu Options, Grocery / Client Choice, Indoor Service, Pre-Packed Boxes / Bags\", \"dietRestrictions\": \"Gluten Free, Vegetarian\", \"foodOfferings\": \"Diapers, Fruits &amp; Vegetables, Household Products, Other, Pet Food / Supplies, Prepared Food / Grab and Go, Shelf Stable/Non-Perishable Goods, Toiletries / Hygiene Products\", \"networkAffiliations\": [{\"regionId\": 65, \"regionName\": \"Food Bank for Larimer County\", \"logoBlobNameSmall\": \"3efe14a7-179c-4f50-b2c1-ec8eede64012.png\", \"website\": \"https://foodbanklarimer.org/\"}], \"timeZoneName\": \"Mountain Standard Time\", \"timeZoneCode\": \"MT\", \"offsetHours\": \"-6\", \"schedules\": [\"Monday 9:00 AM-3:00 PM\", \"Tuesday 9:00 AM-3:00 PM\", \"Wednesday 9:00 AM-3:00 PM\", \"Thursday 9:00 AM-3:00 PM\", \"Friday 9:00 AM-3:00 PM\"], \"services\": [], \"specialHours\": []}",
