Its mission is to express the love of Christ in a tangible way by providing food, clothing, and other essential items to the homeless and impoverished population. The organization operates a thrift store, which serves as the primary source of income for its outreach programs. All proceeds from the store go directly into supporting the community.  Bethel Community Storehouse was established in April 1987 by the Bethel United Methodist Church Missions Outreach. It expanded into an interfaith community mission in December 1989 and was incorporated as a nonprofit entity in February 1991. The storehouse's permanent home was purchased in 1991, and in 2002, an 8,000-square-foot store was added to accommodate a larger food pantry, sorting room, and office.   The organization relies heavily on volunteers, who play a crucial role in stocking the food pantry and thrift store. On average, Bethel Community Storehouse helps feed 1,800 people every month. It also offers emergency food, clothing, housewares, and furniture to qualified low-income clients.   The name \\\"Bethel\\\" means \\\"House of God,\\\" and the organization fulfills the biblical mandate of Matthew 25:40: \\\"In as much as you have done to the least of these my brothers and sisters, you have done unto me\\\". It's a place where neighbors help neighbors, fostering a sense of community and compassion.\", \"notes\": \"\", \"contactName\": \"Linda Smith\", \"contactPhone\": \"505-832-6642\", \"contactEmail\": \"linda@bethelstorehouse.org\", \"servicePrograms\": \"\", \"foodServiceTypes\": \"TEFAP Program\", \"dietRestrictions\": \"Diabetic/Low Sugar, Gluten Free, Other, Vegetarian\", \"foodOfferings\": \"\", \"networkAffiliations\": [{\"regionId\": 71, \"regionName\": \"Roadrunner Food Bank of New Mexico\", \"logoBlobNameSmall\": \"d2c42119-4ccf-487d-89a3-a39cf3f3228b.png\", \"website\": \"https://www.rrfb.org/\"}], \"timeZoneName\": \"Mountain Standard Time\", \"timeZoneCode\": \"MT\", \"offsetHours\": \"-6\", \"schedules\": [\"Tuesday 12:00 PM-3:45 PM\", \"Wednesday 12:00 PM-3:45 PM\", \"Thursday 12:00 PM-3:45 PM\", \"Friday 12:00 PM-3:45 PM\"], \"services\": [], \"specialHours\": []}",
