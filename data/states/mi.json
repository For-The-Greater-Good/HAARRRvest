Two please be patient in line, and Gas Up, our line can get long, we serve 300 cars on a usual basis, sometime near 400, so Gas Up .. there is a process that we have to go through, each car will take a different amount of time , depending on how many families are being represented in that car.. And, Three, one person can pick up food for up to 4 families, BUT they must show us 3 more ID Pictures, usually on their phone, or some bring paper copies. Remember, each car takes time to collect the info., from a couple minutes to maybe 10 minutes ? We never know ..again please be patient. Last, We do offer free clothing ( inside set up) until they run out , after food you are welcome to go around the corner to our side door and come in .. We call this walletless shopping lol..
