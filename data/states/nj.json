This help is free and confidential."},{"id":"17526c13-e77c-4df1-9c25-888fbd6feae5","lat":40.71112929999999,"lng":-74.21152239999999,"name":"Weequahic Branch Library","org":"Weequahic Branch Library","address":"355 Osborne Terrace, Weequahic, NJ 07112","city":"Weequahic","state":"NJ","zip":"07112","phone":"(973) 733-7751","website":"","email":"","description":"Coordinator: Cynthia\tShearin\t9737339309\nStart: 07/01/2025\tEnd: 08/29/2025"},{"id":"d08ab434-6f81-46be-b6bd-905815c595eb","lat":40.2284,"lng":-74.782783,"name":"West End","org":"ROWAN TOWERS","address":"620 West State Street, West End, NJ 08618","city":"West End","state":"NJ","zip":"08618","phone":"(609) 394-0687","website":"","email":"","description":"Tanesia\tJones\t6099893361\nStarts: 06/30/2025\t08/22/2025"},{"id":"d1eb560c-c51e-4dee-9cbd-90e1af03d2ca","lat":40.2291806,"lng":-74.7799558,"name":"West End","org":"EDGEWOOD PARK","address":"530 Edgewood Avenue, West End, NJ 08618","city":"West End","state":"NJ","zip":"08618","phone":"(609) 508-2744","website":"","email":"","description":"Khadijah\tMcQueen\t6099893361\nStarts: 06/30/2025\t08/22/2025"},{"id":"d227c2a0-c071-4bfb-8c1e-68a7cb366a3c","lat":40.2308411,"lng":-74.78226049999999,"name":"West End","org":"TASK MOBILE MEALS @ RESCUE MISSION OF TRENTON","address":"222 North Hermitage Avenue, West End, NJ 08618","city":"West End","state":"NJ","zip":"08618","phone":"(609) 695-5456","website":"https://trentonsoupkitchen.org/get-help/","email":"","description":"Mobile meals service provided by Rescue Mission of Trenton"},{"id":"de2f8d82-6a93-44a8-aa68-d1aa3ac2517b","lat":41.1294192,"lng":-74.36912099999999,"name":"West Milford","org":"Cumac MFP -
