People start lining up between three and 330 Madeline she's always there. She's the one in charge of taking in your information. She will give you all the information that you need once you give your ID she'll make you should make your ticket there. All you have to do is just hand the ticket. She'll scan it and she'll find all your information that you have given to her prior to your registration. Everything is done by computer now so at the first time it might take a few minutes for you to register, but once you registered second time, if you show your ticket, she scans it walk right in take a seat and wait for the numbers to be called. Once your number is called you come and you get your food and you're on your way. I hope this information that I have given you will be very helpful. I am behind the scenes. I do all the computer work in the back. You barely see me but if this information, I hope it has been helpful. Have a nice day and thank you very much. The Food Pantry schedule starts from 430 to 6 630 I believe sometimes if we have a couple of back left over and might run to seven thank you very much.
