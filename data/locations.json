Two please be patient in line, and Gas Up, our line can get long, we serve 300 cars on a usual basis, sometime near 400, so Gas Up .. there is a process that we have to go through, each car will take a different amount of time , depending on how many families are being represented in that car.. And, Three, one person can pick up food for up to 4 families, BUT they must show us 3 more ID Pictures, usually on their phone, or some bring paper copies. Remember, each car takes time to collect the info., from a couple minutes to maybe 10 minutes ? We never know ..again please be patient. Last, We do offer free clothing ( inside set up) until they run out , after food you are welcome to go around the corner to our side door and come in .. We call this walletless shopping lol..

She'll scan it and she'll find all your information that you have given to her prior to your registration. Everything is done by computer now so at the first time it might take a few minutes for you to register, but once you registered second time, if you show your ticket, she scans it walk right in take a seat and wait for the numbers to be called. Once your number is called you come and you get your food and you're on your way. I hope this information that I have given you will be very helpful. I am behind the scenes. I do all the computer work in the back. You barely see me but if this information, I hope it has been helpful. Have a nice day and thank you very much.
